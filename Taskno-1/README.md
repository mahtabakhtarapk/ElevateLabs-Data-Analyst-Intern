### 🔍 Summary of Cleaning Steps

The cleaning process ensured the data is structured and consistent, using the following transformations:

1.  *Column Standardization:* All column headers were standardized to *snake\_case* (e.g., date_added).
2.  *Duplicate Handling:* Checked for and confirmed *no exact duplicate rows* were present.
3.  *Missing Values (Imputation):* Null values in **director**, **cast**, and **country** were filled with the string *'Unknown'*.
4.  *Missing Values (Deletion):* Rows missing data in the critical fields **date_added** or **rating** (approx. 17 rows) were removed.
5.  *Feature Standardization:*
    * The original **duration** column (e.g., '93 min', '4 Seasons') was split into two new, clean columns: **duration_int** (numerical value) and **duration_unit** (unit type).
    * The **date_added** column was converted to a consistent datetime format.
